\section{Extensions}

So far we have only showed how to give a formal meaning to ghost code and
how to erase it from the programs safely with respect to evaluation.

From now, we move towards more realistic examples, where we could show how
ghost code can be used for program specification.

In this section we show how to extend the $g\lambda$-calculus with
 some basic constructions such as conditionals and local bindings, recursive definitions, and access and assignment of global references. In the same time, we extend the typing relation and erase of terms and type, and  reprove the preservation properties of the previous section.
